The game name is Card Wars. The main controls we will make use of here are the W,A,S,D keys to move around and you can also utilise the mouse as a camera controller, to make it easier to direct which way you'll go.

The key aim of the game is to defeat all enemies and obtain the maximum number of pickups (which is 3) then you will win the game by default.

Firstly, you'll spawn at the beginning of a maze-like construct, in which you'll only have access to the left side as you progress along. 
Knowing this, travel as far as you can and you can engage in combat with your first enemy who will also have a pickup placed behind them.
The pickups cannot be collected until you have defeated the enemy. If you try to do so, you will just be put straight into a battle as it is unavoidable based on the placement of the enemies.

Once in battle, you will have multiple options displayed to you in the form of cards. The cards are used by clicking then essentially dragging and dropping them onto your desired enemy to attack.
However, be careful, as some cards have less range than others, so if you try to drag and drop a sword on the most far-back enemy, it will not work as they are out-of-range.
The cards you want to make use of here are bow and poison in this case, you can use all 3 for the closest enemy however though.

There is also a very useful feature you can utilise in battles. This is the feature of combining cards, there are certain cards you can drag and drop onto each other which will create a new combined card.
For example, if you clicked, held, then dragged and dropped the poison card onto the sword card, you can create a new card called 'Poison Knife' then use this card as you see fit.

If you are granted an undesired set of cards and are unable to take your turn as desired, there is an end turn button at the bottom left of the screen which can make you skip a turn, make sure to use this accordingly to your strategy as you don't want your characters to get killed.

Once you are done defeating an enemy, you can walk over to the area behind the enemy where the pickup is and you can store it, upon doing this, you will notice that the pickups collected number will update on the bottom left corner.

After defeating the first enemy, you will notice a puzzle to unlock the next area, you will need to get all of the yellow tiles to be transformed to green then you can unlock the next area. The order of this puzzle varies every time.

Upon defeating all enemies, you will see a text displayed telling you that you've won, after this is briefly displayed, you will then be sent into the main menu screen.
Here you will have an option of whether you want to start a new game or just quit altogether, it is your choice.
