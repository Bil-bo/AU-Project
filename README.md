# AU-Project

Our game is Card Wars.

Use the W,A,S,D keys and the mouse to move.

The aim of the game is to defeat the final boss, but standing in your way are several challenges that you must overcome in order to reach them. Battle enemies, pickup items and rescue allies to make your journey easier. Pickups in particular directly affect the final boss' health, so be on the look out!

After world generation, you will be loaded into a start room in order to gain your bearings. Find rooms with items, enemies, allies, treasure and pickups, but be careful if you enter a hostile room, because the doors will shut behind you, forcing you to fight your way out.

In battle, use your cards to fight the enemies. Note things such as the description, range and cost to get an idea of what your card does. Drag the card over a selectable highlighted target to use it on them.

If you want your cards to pack more punch, you can combine them by dragging one card over another. If they are compatible, the cards will combine into a stronger card for you to use. Try merging poison with Swords, for example!
If none of the cards are usable or desirable, or you are out of energy, you can use the end turn button to refresh your hand, at the cost of giving the enemies a go at you

If you defeat the enemies, you get rewards. Pick the cards that you want to add to your deck to boost your power.

If the game feels too easy or hard, you can change the difficulty before you begin a run.

If you want to stop for a bit, the game saves your position, so you can come back to the exact point you were by clicking continue in the menu
